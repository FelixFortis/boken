Boken: Japanese for adventure, apparently...

This is an app I'm building to showcase what I can do in Rails while I'm searching for employment.

The gist is that you can login and that each user has a goals list.

Then can then create goals and add them to the list. (currently working on this scenario (24Oct13))

(Eventually) Other users can look at all goals that have ever been created, or the goals of their friends, and add them to their list at the click of a button.

Goals can be edited or deleted by users, but will always remain on the global list for others to check out and add to their list if they wish.

Admins can permanently delete goals from the global goal list (e.g. if they are duplicates/don't make any sense etc) to keep things tidy.
